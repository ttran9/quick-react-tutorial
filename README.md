# React Learning App

# Some Information

    - This is [the playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLCuWRxjbgFnPcoXL_VZBqREsvjjXMdq3x) being referenced
    - There will be an initial one branch that is not a part of the video tutorial which is just my initial setup using webpack instead of using create-react-app to generate the boilerplate code for the React app.
        - Boilerplate is just a branch that will not be added to and can be used as a boilerplate react app to get started out with.
        - All the other branches will be changes up to the end of the video.

# Notes for Video:

- Video 1:
  - React isn't completely JavaScript.
  - There is use of transpilers that can compile down what we are writing down (mostly HTML, especially in this video) to JavaScript.
  - JSX: Extension that allows you to write HTML components in the middle of JavaScript.
  - Can import css file due to enhanced JS.
